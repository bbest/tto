```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, message = F, warning = F)
```

_**Purpose**_. This little demonstration is meant to show how global datasets can be consumed and combined with local data to custom build and distribute sustainable development (SDG) indicators transparently, particularly for **SDG 14. Life in the Sea**.

The underlying code should only need to have the 3-letter country code (ie `"SEN"`) changed to be re-run for another country.

Please visit the **Indicators** menu to see the examples.
